# Christoph Cox's Lecture "History of Sound Art" (Part 10)

### 10th part (starts at 01:15:40) of Christoph Cox's Lecture "History of Sound Art"

(1:15:17) Another project is a project - another set of sonic political projects - and there are many, I just chose a couple…Is a project by the Jordenian artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan who describes his project as “forensic listening” and what that means is that he pays close attention to the ways that sound is employed in legal context and often context involving human rights.
So this is – he is actually hired by Human Rights Organization in Palestine to do this particular project which then became an installation project and the project was particulate to determine, to investigate whether is really soldiers had used rubber bullets, as they had claimed or had broken the law by using live emanation in the deaths of two unnamed Palestinian teenagers. And so, sound became crucial there and precisely trying to determine what, you know, what emanation was unlisted in this context and so, also to video images also to sonic images…

(1:16:19)  Another project that he did  - this is a detail from it - was a project involving a project called “Conflicted Phonemes” that map to the use of language in dialect by dots officials to accept or deny asylum -  the asylum request of  Somali – asylum seekers. So this installation tries to (can) map the multiple determinations of accent, right? and the injustice - enjust  using someone speaking voice and having at speaking voice b “A ok you are actually from this stairge or you are not from where you are saying you are”. So they try to map the multiple determinations of accent and it’s a very complicated installation actually that has all these little panels that should have tried to configure these various raise of determinants of accent speech. This piece was accompanied by this piece which is a bit of acoustic foam, it’s an acoustic sculpture that maps out a voice print of two different voices saying the word “you”, right? - one here and the other behind it, right? Now, let’s (to) get a sense of the variation, the sonic variations and differences that make that visible. Ok.

(1:17:30)   Last, I am gonna present here, so I do wanna conclude by turning to film and video as potential  art -  that’s for sonic art, right?, so film and video are in principle auditory and visual, right? We think of them primarily as visual media and the most of the history of cinema, sound has been kind of down play has been that  which accompanies image and which helps to a kind of switcher the connection between two Images which has placed together but also that tries to - that supplements imaging makes it natural. In 1928 right in the beginning of sound cinema, three important Soviet film makers Eisenstein, Pudovkin and Alexandrov used this famous statement on sound saying  like “we know where  sound is gonna go with cinema and it not gonna be good. It’s just gonna be used in the service of the image it’s gonna destroy montage..”. So anyway, they  called for very different kind use of sound. Now you could - there are certainly artists along the way who did this. But I want just focus on two artists who think work with sound in really interesting ways. 
One of them is – and there are lots of them Ι think who work in really reach ways which treat cinema, treat film and video as a sonic art. I wanna focus on one of them which is the work of Luke Fowlera Scottish film maker –music and sound have been central to his work for as long as he’s been working which is really two thousands
But a particular project I think I found really reach is this project called “A Grammar For Listening” which came up 2009 it’s a trilogy of films all each of them it’s a 23 minutes films each done with a different sound artist. So he will – you know - contact this figure, Lee Patterson –English sound artist from Manchester, Eric La Casa Frenchman and Toshiya Tsunoda from Japan.
And in each case he tried to form a genuine collaboration – so what would it mean for image not to, not for sound to accompany image - what would it mean for image and sound work equally right? So, he would take the particular artist to places he thought might interest them and they would take him to places that might interest him visually and then they worked together to compose a film. I am gonna show you  a sure short clip. This is from this film - this is from the second one called “Grammar For Listening”. It’s devided up into these sections with colour bands  in the middle and just to give you a sense of this particular project.How to give a sense of that in a single clip its really  ---- amazing very should accomp. The audio and the visual composition are very much evident in a longer piece.

(1:22:33) One last piece that I wanna focus on in a part this is a plague for a film that is gonna be showing here on Monday - one of my favorites films ever -a film called Leviathan
Comes out at the Sensory Ethnography Lab in - based in- Harvard and run by Lucien Castaing Taylor. If those of you don’t know this project, Sensory Ethnography Lab is artists who, artists and anthropologists, ethnographers who are interested in kind of – instead of should have giving a kind of text dual explication of a particular cultural space - they try to provide a kind of immersive kind  - of immersion into that particular space. So, this is a film that is- that takes place entirely on a ground fish troller on fishing boat after coasted new bad field  which was in the   19thand is still that Americas biggest fishing port and its filmed – amazing filmed with go-pro cameras largely attached to the fishermen’s arms and heads and whatever, so  it’s a very kind of visually designed in film but it’s – I think the sound that helps to take that image which is always flat and regular in front of you and tries, and really can of makes that image envelop you. And I’ll show the trailer, this is the commercial trailer for. And, the trailer is just a clip from the film- it’s a particular clip from the film but I really encourage you to see and  …One of the reasons why – the sound design is done by Ernst Karel who is a fantastic sound artist guy who does film recording in presences work in various more sound-art contexts but he is the manager for the sensory ethnography lab and also the guy who does other sound and really the film is so extraordinary sonically and really an example of film as a kind of sonic art. So, here is the trailer.
